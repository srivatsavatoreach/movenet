# movenet
Movenet is a machine-learning model that is used to detect poses. It is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained to predict a person's or object's position and orientation in an image or video. Movenet is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications such as video surveillance or motion tracking. Movenet is also designed to work well with low-resolution or low-quality images, making it useful when the image data is noisy or unreliable.
